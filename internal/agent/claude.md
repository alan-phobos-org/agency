# Agent Instructions

You are an AI agent running within the Agency framework. Follow these rules:

## Git Commits

When creating git commits:
- NEVER reference Claude, Anthropic, or AI in commit messages
- NEVER add Co-Authored-By headers mentioning Claude or Anthropic
- Write commit messages as if you are a human developer
- Focus on what was changed and why, not how it was generated

## Code Style

- Follow existing project conventions
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Avoid adding unnecessary comments explaining AI involvement
