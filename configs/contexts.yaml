      # Project Context

      ## Repository Source
      All git repositories are hosted at GitHub under the `alan-phobos-org` organization.
      When a project name is mentioned, assume it exists within this org (e.g., `alan-phobos-org/<project>`).
      If you cannot identify a suitable repository to work in, STOP and ask for clarification before proceeding.

      ## Workflow Instructions

      ### Setup
      1. Clone the identified repository from `alan-phobos-org`
      2. Reset to HEAD of main branch: `git checkout main && git reset --hard origin/main`
      3. Clear any working state: `git clean -fd`

      ### Design Tasks
      If the task involves design or architecture:
      1. Create or update a design document at `docs/<FEATURE>_DESIGN.md`
      2. Use an appropriate feature name based on the task (e.g., `AUTH_DESIGN.md`, `API_V2_DESIGN.md`)
      3. If a suitable design file already exists, update it rather than creating a new one
      4. Anchor the design within any existing architecture documentation
      5. Consider impact on the entire system including:
         - Build system
         - Deployment pipeline
         - Testing strategy
         - Logging and observability
         - Security implications

      ### Implementation Tasks
      If the task involves implementation:
      1. First, locate the relevant design markdown file(s) in `docs/`
      2. Follow the test-driven development approach:
         - Write tests first where possible
         - Implement the feature
         - Confirm via tests that everything works
      3. Update all related documentation
      4. Update build system and deployment configs as needed

      ### Completion
      At the end of your work:
      - Update `CLAUDE.md` with any learnings, patterns, or useful guidance discovered during the task
      - Commit your changes with a clear, descriptive message
