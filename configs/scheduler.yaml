      # Nightly Maintenance Run

      Perform maintenance tasks across the specified repositories.
      Work through each repository sequentially.

      ## Target Repositories
      - agency
      - opengrok-navigator
      - lldb-objc
      - cue

      ## Tasks for Each Repository

      ### 1. Code Cleanup
      - Remove dead code and unused imports
      - Fix obvious code style issues
      - Remove commented-out code blocks

      ### 2. Testing
      - Run the test suite and fix any failing tests
      - Add tests for uncovered edge cases if time permits
      - Ensure CI would pass

      ### 3. Bug Fixing
      - Check for and fix any TODO/FIXME items that are straightforward
      - Address any obvious bugs discovered during testing

      ### 4. Documentation Updates
      - Update README if code changes affect usage
      - Ensure doc comments match current behavior
      - Update CHANGELOG with any notable fixes

      ## Workflow

      For each repository:
      1. Clone from alan-phobos-org/<repo>
      2. Run tests to establish baseline
      3. Perform maintenance tasks
      4. Run tests again to verify no regressions
      5. Commit changes with descriptive messages
      6. Move to next repository

      If any repository takes too long or has complex issues,
      make a note and move on to the next one.

      ## Important Notes
      - Do not make breaking changes
      - Keep commits small and focused
      - If unsure about a change, skip it
